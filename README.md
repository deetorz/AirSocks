Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This is a fun project that my partners, Anthony and Mel, and I made in the span of one week. We were tasked with making an AirBnB clone and also advised to not take the theme too seriously. Thus, we made Air Socks. Wet socks? Hole in a sock? Need a sock puppet? Air Socks has you covered.

Web-first design with responsiveness for smaller devices coming later (maybe).
